This might seem obvious, but it's important to note that the most secure systems are the ones that are least likely to be compromised. This is why we need security measures in place to protect our systems.

## Implementing Secure Systems

On today's blog post, I'll be discussing the importance of hardening workstations and servers.

**Note:** Applications, services, and protocols that are strictly necessary for the operation of the system should be the only ones running on the system to reduce the attack surface.

First, let's cover endpoint security software.

### 1. Endpoint Security Software

Enpoints are any device that is used to access the system. This includes laptops, desktops, and mobile devices, virtual machines, IoT devices, etc.

Endpoint security software is designed to protect endpoints from malware, viruses, and other malicious software.

### 2. Types of Endpoint Security Software

- Antivirus Software
- Endpoint detection and response (EDR)
- Host intrusion detection and response (XDR)
- Host intrusion prevention systems (HIPS)

## Hardening Workstations

- Disable unnecessary ports
- Enable PowerShell logging
- Disk encryption
  - Full Disk Encryption (FDE)
  - BitLocker
