## What happened this Week?

- Learned about remote attestation (Chapter 5 in the SY0-701 Study Guide)
- Continued course on Cardano Academy
- Learned about consensus algorithms and BGP (Message Transfer)

## Remote Attestation (via TPM)

Remote attestation procedures (RATS) are mechanisms to verify the integrity and trustworthiness of remote systems or devices during the boot cycle. Integrity ensures that the system has not been tampered with, while trustworthiness confirms that the system is running trusted software and configurations.

### Actors

- **Verifier** – The entity that evaluates the trustworthiness of the remote system
- **Prover** – The system being evaluated

### How It Works

- **Measurement Collection:** The TPM (a hardware chip on the motherboard) measures and stores the system state at different stages (e.g., BIOS, bootloader, OS, applications) in Platform Configuration Registers (PCRs).
- **Quote Generation:** The prover generates a quote, which includes the PCR values and a nonce. This quote is signed by the TPM using an Attestation Identity Key (AIK).
- **Quote Transmission:** The prover sends the signed quote to the verifier.
- **Verification:** The verifier checks whether the quote's signature was generated by a trusted TPM (using a TPM-specific key). It then compares the PCR values against known good values and verifies the nonce to ensure freshness.
- **Decision:** Based on the verification results, the verifier decides whether to trust the prover.

## Models of Remote Attestation

### The Passport Model

In this model, the prover presents a "passport" (the signed quote) to the verifier. The verifier checks the passport's authenticity and the information it contains (PCR values) to decide whether to trust the prover.

**Use Case:** Suitable for scenarios where the verifier needs to quickly and repeatedly check the trustworthiness of the prover.

### The Background Check Model

In this model, the verifier performs a more thorough "background check" on the prover. The verifier not only checks the signed quote but also performs additional checks, such as verifying the prover's identity and history.

**Use Case:** Suitable for scenarios where the verifier needs to establish a higher level of trust, such as in critical infrastructure or high-security environments.

### General Use Cases

- **Secure Boot:** Ensuring that a system boots into a known good state.
- **Supply Chain Security:** Verifying the integrity of devices in the supply chain.
- **Remote Management:** Ensuring that remote systems are in a trusted state before allowing them to join a network or access sensitive data.

### General Workflow

1. Measurement and Extension
2. Quote Request
3. Quote Generation
4. Quote Transmission
5. Verification
6. Decision

### Real World Scenario

A company wants to make sure all employee laptops are running a trusted OS version before allowing them to connect to the corporate network.

The company can use remote attestation to verify the integrity of each laptop's OS. The laptops (provers) would generate ***quotes*** which includes the ***PCR values***, and the company's server (verifier) would check these quotes to ensure the laptops are running the correct OS version.

**PCR values:** Hashed values that are stored in specific registers (Platform Configuration Registers) within a TPM.

**Quotes:** A quote is a signed report generated by the TPM that includes the current PCR values and a nonce (a random number used to ensure freshness). The quote serves as a proof of the system's state at a particular point in time.

## More Attestation Models (Microsoft Azure)

### Hardware-Based Attestation

- **Intel SGX Attestation**; Set of security-related instruction codes built into Intel CPU.
- **AMD SEV Attestation**; AMD Secure Encrypted Virtualization Verifies the integrity of VMs running on SEV-enabled hardware.
- **Arm CCA Attestation**; Arm Confidential Compute Architecture (CCA) provides hardware-enforced isolation for confidential computing workloads on Arm-based platforms.
- **TPM-Based Attestation**; Hardware attestation that involves checking PCR values.

### Software-Based Attestation

- **Open Enclave SDK**; Open source framework for building confidential computing applications; Cross-Platform Support

### Cloud-Based Attestation

- **Azure Attestation Service**; Remote attestation for VMs

## Next Chapter

## Consensus Algorithms and the Byzantine Generals Problem

### Two important properties for designing a consensus algorithm

- It must continually make progress to ensure that a decision is eventually made. (Liveness)
- If two entities commit to a decision, they must commit to the same decision. (Safety)

### Step-by-step Analogy Using a Money Withdrawal Scenario

1. You request money
2. The ATM asks for approval
3. Multiple parties verify the request
4. Consensus is reached
5. The ATM gives you cash

### How This Relates to a **Consensus Algorithm** in Blockchain

- Nodes in a blockchain network work together to validate transactions.
- Instead of relying on one central authority consensus algorithms ensure that multiple computers (nodes) agree on the state of the system.
- If most nodes agree that a transaction is valid (like your withdrawal request), it gets approved and added to the blockchain.

### Fault Tolerance in Consensus: **CFT vs. BFT**

**Crash Fault-Tolerant (CFT):** Loyal but can fail unpredictably.
**Byzantine Fault-Tolerant (BFT):** Disloyal, actively disrupts communication.
**Causes of Failure:** Bugs, hardware malfunctions, or malicious attacks prevent consensus.

## This Week's Game Plan

1. Complete Chapters 6 and 7 in the SY0-701 Study Guide
2. Progress with Cardano Academy content
3. Get comfortable using BurpSuite
4. Dedicate more time to aircrack-ng
5. Continue reading scientific papers (still have so much to read)
