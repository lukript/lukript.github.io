## Screened Subnet (DMZ)

In today’s cybersecurity landscape, protecting internal networks from external threats is non-negotiable. One effective strategy is implementing a screened subnet, also known as a demilitarized zone (DMZ). This setup adds an extra layer of security by isolating publicly accessible services from the internal network.

### How It Works

A screened subnet is a segmented network positioned between an external network (e.g., the internet) and an internal network. It typically houses public-facing services such as web servers, email servers, or proxy servers, keeping them separate from sensitive internal resources.

### Why Use a Screened Subnet?

- **Prevents Direct Access to Internal Networks** – Even if a public-facing server is compromised, attackers do not get immediate access to internal resources.
- **Enhances Security Controls** – Traffic can be monitored and filtered more effectively.
- **Reduces Attack Surface** – Limits the exposure of critical internal systems to external threats.
- **Prevents Lateral Movement** – A DMZ prevents an unauthorized entity from moving laterally through the network architecture, restricting access to sensitive internal systems and minimizing potential damage.

## Automated Security Workflow

In an automated security workflow, raw data from monitored devices such as data generated by Syslog notifications is aggregated on a security information and event management (SIEM) system.

A SIEM system is an application that automatically monitors and analyzes event logs in real time. The hosts that are monitored by a SIEM system are typically configured with an agent that reports to the SIEM server when a suspicious event occurs. This enables the SIEM server to detect and track malicious behavior in real time.

A SOAR system provides a centralized stack of security tools and processes that can automate many common security tasks. A SOAR system can correlate events from a SIEM system, perform threat analysis, and then mitigate many low-level threats with minimal human interaction. The SOAR system communicates directly with the Security Operations Center (SOC) team by sending alerts and notifications.

The SOC team can review automated responses that have been performed or queued by the SOAR system and can directly respond to threats that require human interaction.

## Types of Access Control Models

- **ACM (Access Control Matrix)**: A conceptual model that defines the permissions each subject (user/process) has for each object (resource) in a system. It's represented as a table where rows are subjects, columns are objects, and cells contain permissions.
- **DAC (Discretionary Access Control)**: A model where the owner of a resource determines who can access it and what operations they can perform. File permissions in operating systems like Linux are a common example.
- **RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)**: A model where access permissions are associated with roles, and users are assigned to appropriate roles. This simplifies administration as permissions are managed at the role level rather than individually.
- **ACL (Access Control List)**: A list of permissions attached to an object that specifies which users or system processes are granted access and what operations they can perform. Commonly used in file systems and networking equipment.

## Common Cybersecurity Policies

- **NDA (Non-Disclosure Agreement)**: A legal contract between parties that outlines confidential information they share but wish to restrict from third-party access. In cybersecurity, NDAs protect sensitive information about vulnerabilities, security architectures, or penetration testing results.
- **MOU (Memorandum of Understanding)**: A formal agreement documenting mutual accord between parties. In security contexts, MOUs often establish frameworks for information sharing, incident response cooperation, or joint security initiatives between organizations.
- **SLA (Service Level Agreement)**: A contract defining the expected service quality, responsibilities, and metrics between service providers and clients. Security SLAs typically specify response times for security incidents, uptime guarantees, and security control requirements.
- **AUP (Acceptable Use Policy)**: A set of rules and guidelines that define how an organization's network, systems, and data should be used. It helps prevent misuse and ensures security compliance.
- **ISA (Interconnection Service Agreement)**: A formal contract that outlines the security requirements, responsibilities, and terms for interconnecting IT systems between organizations.
- **IAA (Interagency Agreement)**: A document that defines the terms, conditions, and responsibilities between government agencies collaborating on a shared initiative or system.
