This week’s objective is to revisit core concepts of blockchain technology through an in-depth review of official documentation and foundational papers (linked below), with a focus on applying these principles within the context of the Cardano Network.

## Blockchain

- Tamper evident (Blocks are linked together)
- Tamper resistant (Blocks cannot be modified)
- Decentralized
- Private/Public key pairs

### Types of Blockchain

- Public Blockchain
- Private Blockchain
- Permissioned Blockchain vs. Permissionless Blockchain
- Consortium Blockchain
  - Examples: R3 Corda, Quorum
  - Use Cases: Financial Services, Supply Chain, Insurance
- Enterprise Ethereum Alliance (EEA)
  - Aims to standardize Ethereum for enterprise use
  - Secure, scalable, efficient
  - Hybrid Blockchain
  - Use Case:  Business where you need to combine public and private blockchain to maintain privacy and security.

### Blockchain Components

- Nodes
- Peers
- Validators
- Miners

### Blockchain Consensus

- Proof of Work
- Proof of Stake
- Delegated Proof of Stake

### Blockchain Architecture

- Consensus Mechanism
- Consensus Algorithm
- Consensus Protocol
- Consensus Mechanism

## Cardano Academy

I recently came across [Cardano Academy](https://cardano.academy/) while browsing the internet. It offers a well-structured introduction to blockchain fundamentals and the Cardano ecosystem, including topics such as the Ouroboros proof-of-stake protocol, smart contracts, and decentralized governance. One notable feature is the issuance of a certificate upon course completion, which adds credibility and serves as a motivational incentive.

Completed the CBCA Practice Exam today and plan to continue with more of the course content tomorrow. Today’s focus is on deepening my theoretical foundation—specifically by studying the NISTIR 8202: Blockchain Technology Overview and the Blockchain Fundamentals paper. Taking a balanced approach between applied learning and conceptual understanding.

## Supecharge Your Learning

A while ago I discovered a service that reads documents, websites, etc. to you. I've been using it to listen to the NISTIR 8202 paper. It's a great way to consume information and it's much faster than reading it.
