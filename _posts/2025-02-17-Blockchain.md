This weekâ€™s objective is lies on revisiting key concepts of blockchain technology by reviewing  official documentation and papers (linked below) and applying them to the Cardano Network.

## Blockchain

- Tamper evident (Blocks are linked together)
- Tamper resistant (Blocks cannot be modified)
- Decentralized
- Private/Public key pairs

### Types of Blockchain

- Public Blockchain
- Private Blockchain
- Permissioned Blockchain vs. Permissionless Blockchain
- Consortium Blockchain
  - Examples: R3 Corda, Quorum
  - Use Cases: Financial Services, Supply Chain, Insurance
- Enterprise Ethereum Alliance (EEA)
  - Aims to standardize Ethereum for enterprise use
  - Secure, scalable, efficient
  - Hybrid Blockchain
  - Use Case:  Business where you need to combine public and private blockchain to maintain privacy and security.

### Blockchain Components

- Nodes
- Peers
- Validators
- Miners

### Blockchain Consensus

- Proof of Work
- Proof of Stake
- Delegated Proof of Stake

### Blockchain Architecture

- Consensus Mechanism
- Consensus Algorithm
- Consensus Protocol
- Consensus Mechanism

## Cardano Academy

I stumpled upon [Cardano Academy](https://cardano.academy/) while browsing the internet. It's a good starting point to understand the key concepts of Cardano and blockchain technology in general. Best part is that it's free and you'll get a certificate at the end of the course (which is always a good motivation booster).

Did the CBCA Practice Exam today, going to do more of the course tomorrow. Today is more about reading the NISTIR 8202 paper and the Blockchain Fundamentals paper.

## Supecharge Your Learning

A while ago I discovered a service that reads documents, websites, etc. to you. I've been using it to listen to the NISTIR 8202 paper. It's a great way to consume information and it's much faster than reading it.
